# Correlation Scan

Correlation scan is a statistical framework developed to estimate local genetic correlations between two traits based on fixed window size in a fixed sliding window. The framework uses BLUP solution of SNP effects to estimate these local genetic correlations. In addition, correlation scan can identify drivers and antagonizing regions affecting trait correlations; for the driver regions,the local correlation estimate has the same direction, positive or negative, as the global genetic correlation; in antagonizing windows it is the opposite. For more details, see the [Correlation Scan paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.05.467409).
